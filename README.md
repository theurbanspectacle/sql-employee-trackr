# sql-employee-trackr

## Getting started
- Use the `seed.sql` file to setup the database. The database should not exist.
- The Node.JS project expects the password to be inside `SQL_PASSWORD` environment variable.  Can be set via `export SQL_PASSWORD=PASSWORD`.  The setup uses `root` for the user account.
